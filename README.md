# Female Investor Track
It's 2021 and 65% of Venture Capital firms have no female partners. It's time for change. Starting at Dorrm Room Fund.

The Female Investor Track is a 3-week masterclass to help women who are just starting their careers in venture transition and grow in the industry. We are looking to build a strong cohort of passionate, eager, and driven female students who will learn from the best investors, fund managers, and founders in the game.
