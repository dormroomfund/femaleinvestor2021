        <div id="investor-track-faq">
          <p>
            <strong>1. What is the time commitment like?</strong> <br />
            Each session will run from 6-7:30pm EST/ 3-4:30pm PST on Mondays and Thursdays from June 13th-July 28th. On
            July 28th we will have our final event where we will judge the Female Founder Track pitches!
            <br /><br />

            <strong>2. Are you focusing on a certain level of experience for participants?</strong><br />
            The program is focused on building a strong foundation for understanding venture capital and topics such as
            business models, investment frameworks, and diligence networks. Though we welcome all levels of experience,
            we are catering the learnings to those early to venture or for those who feel like they want a stronger
            grasp of the fundamentals!
            <br /><br />

            <strong>3. What mentorship opportunities do you provide?</strong><br />
            Our program offers three main avenues of mentorship:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li style="color: white !important"><strong>Cohort-based learning:</strong> Learn from a community
              consisting of the strongest female and non-binary students around the country. We hope that this offers
              means to build connections with those who have the same passion and eagerness for venture capital!</li>
            <li style="color: white !important"><strong>DRF Mentorship:</strong> Throughout the 6 weeks, you will be
              paired with a current partner/recent alumni from DRF who will offer advice tailored to being on the team
              and transitioning into VC.</li>
            <li style="color: white !important"><strong>Industry Mentorship:</strong> Along with a DRF Mentor, you will
              have an industry mentor, a current female investor in VC who will offer you tailored and unique insight
              into their experiences in the industry.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>4. How is <a href="https://femaleinvestors.dormroomfund.com/" target="_blank">FIT</a>
              different to <a href="https://femalefounders.dormroomfund.com/" target="_blank">FFT</a>?
              Are their opportunities to do both?</strong> <br />
            <a href="https://femaleinvestors.dormroomfund.com/" target="_blank">FIT</a>
            and
            <a href="https://femalefounders.dormroomfund.com/" target="_blank">FFT</a>
            both run simultaneously so we encourage you to apply to one program over the other based on what you are
            looking to learn and the time you have availability.
            Female Investor Track runs for half the time as
            <a href="https://femalefounders.dormroomfund.com/" target="_blank">Female Founder Track</a>
            and geared towards those who are considering investing in the future.
            However, there will be multiple opportunities to interact with the cohort throughout the program including
            the chance to judge the pitches of this years Female Founders!

            <br /><br />
            <strong>5. What is <a href="https://www.dormroomfund.com/" target="_blank">Dorm Room
                Fund</a>?</strong><br />
            We're a student-run venture fund backed by First Round. We invest in startups where at least one person on
            the founding team is a student (undergraduate or graduate). Our investment team is run by student leaders,
            entrepreneurs, and innovators across the country.
