        <div id="investor-track-faq">
          <p>
            <strong>1. What is the time commitment like?</strong> <br />
            Each session will run from 6-7:30pm EST/ 3-4:30pm PST on Mondays and Thursdays from June 13th-July 28th. On

            <br /><br />

            <strong>2. Are you focusing on a certain level of experience for participants?</strong><br />
            The program is focused on building a strong foundation for understanding venture capital and topics such as
            business models, investment frameworks, and diligence networks. Though we welcome all levels of experience,
            we are catering the learnings to those early to venture or for those who feel like they want a stronger
            grasp of the fundamentals!
            <br /><br />

            <strong>3. What mentorship opportunities do you provide?</strong><br />
            Our program offers three main avenues of mentorship:
          </p>

            <li style="color: white !important"><strong>Cohort-based learning:</strong> Learn from a community
              consisting of the strongest female and non-binary students around the country. We hope that this offers
